      The UPLB Grange Association aspires its members to become: versatile, skilled, innovative
      and competent individuals who are rational, disciplined, and passionate in protecting
      the environment and in contribution to the growth of the society; proactive citizens who are able to
      lead in their area of competence and yet work well in teams as a result of their mature outlook
      in life willing to pay forward to the succeeding generation of Grange associates - the legacy that
      the Grange Association bestows upon them.

      The UPLB Grange Association shall mold young students who will proudly carry the name of the association
      and UPLB - students that their peers will look up to for who they are, what they do, and what they stand for.
      Resident members of the Grange Association undergo programs that provide mentoring beyond the academic curriculum
      of the University: training sessions, lectures, structured experiences, on-the-job training with Grange Alumni,
      and activities that will benefit both the organization and the society. The association is geared to equip resident
      members and to give them the competitive advantage for leadership roles in the future, either as entrepreneurs,
      members of the UP academe, or as professionals in their chosen fields.
